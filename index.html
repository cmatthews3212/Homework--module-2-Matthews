            <h2>Christine Matthews</h2>
            <p>
                Born in raised in WI, Christine's adventure to software engineering started with her move to Chicago, IL in 2020.
                She came to Chicago to work on her Bachelor's in Communications, which she received May of 2023. 
                Through her time in college, she found herself working in her college's ITS Support center. 
                During this time, she began to teach herself coding on the side. She really enjoyed what she was learning
                and desired to use those skills in her professional life. She reached out to the WebTech department of her college
                which was the department that ran all of her college's websites. They mentioned there was an open position in their department
                so she applied and moved to the position of Technical Analyst, where she was able to use the skills she was learning
                under the supervision of the Technical Product Analyst. By the time she graduated, the position of Technical Product Analyst
                opened and she was able to interview for it and ended up promoting to that position full-time! After a year, her boss and she 
                decided it would be useful for her to get a full-stack certificate in software engineering and she was given the opportunity to 
                learn at Northwesters in their Coding Bootcamp! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you can see a portfolio of her work in the bootcamp, showcasing her advanced CSS skills!
